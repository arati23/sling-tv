## Web Resources Client Library
A web resources client library can be defined at the template level (see `./appResourcesClientlib` component policy configuration).
This client library has to provide the following structure:

```json
{
  "<client library folder>": {
    "jcr:primaryType": "cq:ClientLibraryFolder",
    "allowProxy": true,
    "categories": [
      "<category name>"
    ],
    "css.txt": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:file"},
    "resources": {
      "jcr:primaryType": "nt:folder"
      }
  }
}
```

The following files are expected in the `resources` folder, for maximum compatibility:

Filename|Browser|Size
--------|-------|----
apple-touch-icon-180x180.png|Safari on iPhone| 180px x 180px
apple-touch-icon-167x167.png|Safari on iPad Pro| 167px x 167px
apple-touch-icon-152x152.png|Safari on iPad, iPad Mini| 152px x 152px
apple-touch-icon-120x120.png|Safari on iPhone| 120px x 120px

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.wcm.components.page.v2.sharing` client library category that contains the JavaScript
required to enable social sharing. It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.wcm.components.page.v2.editor` editor client library category that includes JavaScript
handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
